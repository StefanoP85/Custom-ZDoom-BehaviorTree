# Custom-ZDoom-BehaviorTree
More sophisticated behavior in ZDoom actors with behavior trees.

This mod implements basic Behavior Tree management in ZScript in ZDoom; it's based on the [Inkoalawetrust's KAI library](https://github.com/inkoalawetrust/KAI) and on my [https://github.com/StefanoP85/Custom-ZDoom-PathFinding].
The 3D model for the shield comes from [Lewisk3's HaloDoom](https://github.com/Lewisk3/HaloDoom_GZDoomVersion).
The NFG sprites and sounds come from the STRAIN.WAD from Alpha Dog Alliance, which inspired this mod.
